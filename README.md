***Warrant***

Files/codes here are allowed to be edited, distributed, and re-used for any academic/teaching purpose without any warrant. However, you are strongly suggested to share your codes with the public if you are planning to use codes here. Let's work together to guarantee the reproducibility of experiments and the verifiability of claims in publications. We believe that this is meaningful to facilitate future research of the machine learning community.


***Disclaimer***

Note that the mentioned reproducibility and verifiability do not necessarily guarantee the (absolute) correctness of academic claims in a scientific publication. Future research may deny or modify or improve the philosophies, methods, models, and/or claims conveyed in this article. But readers should not try to "find bones from an egg", and the codes here are just for their reference, not for their unfriendly criticism. Of course, the authors are open to learning, and friendly comments are always welcomed.
